# Introduction

Hello, my name is Claire Mobley. I am 23 years old and currently attending the Mailman School of Public Health studying Epidemiology with a certificate in Comparative Effectiveness and Outcomes Research. I am interested in Health Economics and Outcomes Research consulting after I complete my master's program. Outside of the classroom, I enjoy hiking, solving crossword puzzles, and traveling to new places!
